    "description": "   Designed and built as a modern replacement for a legacy directory, Find a Program is a public-facing search tool that helps parents and guardians across Maryland locate\n        high-quality child care programs. Built from scratch as a Vue and TypeScript single-page\n        application, the platform utilizes an existing API and uses centralized client-side state\n        management to deliver fast, responsive search results across all devices. I led the product\n        design and front-end development, including early prototyping and stakeholder presentations\n        to the Maryland Department of Education. The design goal was to make searching for child\n        care feel as intuitive as booking a hotel- centered around a single, flexible search input\n        that understands location and intent, with optional filters available for refining\n        results. This approach replaced a slow, checkbox-heavy legacy experience with a streamlined,\n        mobile-first interface that prioritizes clarity, performance, and ease of use. The final\n        system serves thousands of families statewide and supports discovery of programs with\n        quality ratings and eligibility for Child Care Scholarships.",

Built as a\n            Vue and TypeScript single-page application with centralized client-side state\n            management, the system guides programs through a multi-stage accreditation process:\n            standards review, self-appraisal, improvement planning, validation, and ongoing support,\n            all while remaining fully usable on mobile devices. I led product design and front-end\n            architecture, developing and pitching the initial prototype to the Maryland Department\n            of Education and aligning a cross-functional development team around a shared UX vision.\n            The interface was intentionally designed to feel familiar and trustworthy, prioritizing\n            clear workflows, accessible design, and human-centered language. Dashboards, messaging,\n            and visual hierarchy were carefully shaped to help users understand where they are in\n            the process, what they've completed, and what comes next-- reducing confusion in a\n            system with inherently complex requirements.\n          <\/p>\n\n          <p>\n            Beyond improving the experience for participating programs, the rebuilt platform\n            significantly streamlined internal workflows for Maryland EXCELS administrators. Manual\n            processes and ad hoc workarounds were replaced with in-system automation wherever\n            possible, reducing administrative overhead while improving consistency, visibility, and\n            support across the accreditation lifecycle.\n          <\/p>",
